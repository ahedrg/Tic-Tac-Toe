# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game using Python & Tkinter

This project is a smart and interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built with Python's `tkinter` for the graphical user interface and a strong AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**. It was created as part of **CodSoft Internship Task 2**.

---

##  Features

- Player vs AI with Minimax logic (hard to beat!)
-  Restart button to quickly play again
-  Smart AI move evaluation using Alpha-Beta Pruning
-  User-friendly GUI using `tkinter`
-  Detects win, loss, or draw and displays result

##  How to Play
- Choose your symbol: X or O
- The AI automatically picks the other symbol
- Players take turns clicking the grid
- The first to align 3 of their symbols in a row/column/diagonal wins
- If all squares are filled without a winner, it's a draw

## Project Structure
Tkinter GUI with styled buttons and layout
- Minimax algorithm for unbeatable AI
 Game logic functions:
- check_winner()
- is_draw()
- minimax()
- ai_move()
- player_move()
UI handlers:
- setup_start_screen()
- setup_board()
- disable_all_buttons()

## Concepts Used
- Python GUI programming with tkinter
- Recursive algorithms
- Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning optimization
- Event-driven programming
- Game state management

## Future Enhancements
- Add sound effects
-  Add score tracking
- Make layout responsive for various screen sizes
-  Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
